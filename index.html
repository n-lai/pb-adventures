                    Our adventure began with an app my cousin told me to download with her, and to be honest, I thought it was silly and nothing would come out of it. It was just a slow form of Tinder, and guys on Tinder are guys you'd at best only see once and never again. Still, it served as a welcome ego boost every time I got a like and eased me back into the dating game that I was slightly hesitant to play.

                    I only wanted to test the waters, but then I met you and suddenly I was no longer dipping my foot because you had dragged me into the water with you, and against all expectations, instead of drowning, I found myself in the middle of my greatest adventure with you.

                  I've had the most amazing year with you, from watching my favorite soccer team play at Levi's Stadium, to going from barely being able to balance on our snowboards on an easy run at Northstar to conquering our first double black diamond run at Kirkwood in just the span of a season, to fulfilling my longtime wish of spending a day at Disneyland running around like we were five years old again with Mouse Ears on and pigging out on Dole Whip when we got tired.

                  You're the better half that I never expected to find, and I'm truly grateful for everything you've done for me - for your generosity when it comes to buying me food, for joining me in hermit-mode and cooking for me when I needed to get work done, for never complaining about how I never have time to do anything but stay at home and code, for the countless times that you've had to turn down your friends because you decided spending time with me took priority, and mostly for being the most considerate and patient boyfriend I've ever had the pleasure of having.

                  Believe it or not, I wasn't always the "derp" you're accustomed to seeing. Or perhaps, more accurately, deep down I was - I just never felt comfortable enough around anyone to show it. Either way, it has been one of my greatest joys to be able to completely shed my facade and be myself around you knowing full well that you will still love me no matter how strange I am (teddies and all, amongst other things).

                  To say that what we have is something that some spend their entire lives looking for and never find would be a stretch, but I am confident enough to say that what we have is incredibly special. It's special in the way your face lights up when you smile at me and in the way where we can talk about everything and nothing at all. It's special in the way your hand finds mine when we're walking together and the kisses we share. It's special in the way where we can spend hours on end together and it would feel like no time passed at all.

                    I can't wait to have more adventures with you, and I'm excited to see what life has in store for us next. Here's to more derping around, kisses and hugs, homemade steak and crab dinners, long walks on the beach, and basketball bets I'll probably lose.
