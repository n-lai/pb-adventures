To my greatest supporter, best friend, and better half. Happy one year anniversary!

Our adventure began with an app my cousin told me to download with her, and to be honest, I thought it was silly and nothing would come out of it. It was just a slow form of Tinder, and guys on Tinder are guys you'd at best only see once and never agin. Still, it served as a welcome ego boost every time I got a like and eased me back into the dating game that I was slightly hesitant to play.  

I only wanted to test the waters, but then I met you and suddenly I was no longer dipping my foot because you had dragged me into the water with you, and against all expectations, instead of drowning, I found myself in the middle of my greatest adventure with you.

I've had the most amazing year with you, from watching my favorite soccer team play at Levi's Stadium, to going from barely being able to balance on our snowboards on an easy run at Northstar to conquering our first double black diamond run at Kirkwood in just the span of a season, to fulfilling my longtime wish of spending a day at Disneyland running around like we were five years old again with Mouse Ears on and pigging out on Dole Whip when we got tired.

You're the better half that I never expected to find, and I am truly grateful for everything you've done for me - for your generosity when it comes to buying me food, for joining me in hermit-mode and cooking for me when I needed to get work done, for never complaining about how I never have time to do anything but stay at home and code, for the countless times that you've had to turn down your friends because you decided spending time with me took priority, and mostly for being the most considerate and patient boyfriend I've ever had the pleasure of having.
